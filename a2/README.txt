Question 1:
--------------------------
Build:
Load 'assignment1.sln' into Visual Studio
Ensure the files 'question1.cpp', 'common.h', and 'main.cpp' are loaded into the project from the solution explorer
Build and run (Configuration Debug, x86)

The robot is comprised of a sphere, generated using icosphere.cpp, a cube, and a 'tube' which
is made up of 6 quads.
The coloring is a bit strange, because I am multiplying the value of the color by the z value
of each vertice's position. Later, I'd like this to be multiplied by the distance from the camera
rather than the distance from the object's center.
There is no interactivity.

Question 2: TODO
